A big part of my day job as an engineer is understanding how things work.  Being able to look at the latest Wi-Fi connected thing-a-matron and infer the general hardware and software architecture is very useful, but a lot of the magic is gone.  New projects tend to be more development work than exciting exploration.  This really is a good thing.  Every year I look back and think 'Wow, I didn't know anything last year, but now I do!' (at least until next year).  Unfortunately, the gains in productivity were at the cost of wonderment.

I was describing some very basic electronic components (buttons, potentiometers, thermistors, etc.) to an intern the other day and I was incredibly jealous seeing the excitement on his face.  That was me 10 years ago.  I probably would have traded brains with him on the spot if it was an option.  I want that back.

In college whenever I was struggling with some complex multivariable calculus problem my friend Duc would come over and say 'Well, it’s just math!'.  To him it was ‘just math’.  Trivial.  To me it felt like the plans to build the sun from scratch written in the Klingon equivalent of pig-Latin.  Lately my hobby projects have been pure software projects and have become 'just software'.  Trivial.  More work than fun.

Enter the Keezer!

The idea to build a keezer (keg + freezer) came while chatting with a neighbor (and drinking beer).  It sounded like the ideal project.  Plenty of new territory to explore with the Co2 system, refrigeration, pumps, valves, etc. and ample opportunity to make it my own with a touch screen UI, cloud data logging and just maybe - a driver seat.
