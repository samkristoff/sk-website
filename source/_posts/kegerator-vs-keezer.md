DIY beer machines typically fall into two main categories:

**Kegerator** 
*A small refrigerator designed or adapted to hold a keg from which cold beer can be dispensed.*

**Keezer **
 *A small freezer converted into a refrigerator designed or adapted to hold a keg from which cold beer can be dispensed.*

### Why a Keezer
After looking at a bunch of mini-fridge options I decided to go with the Keezer design for two reasons:
  * I want a touch screen user interface for my beer machine.  A sub $200 mini fridge can barely hold 2 corny kegs and I want 4 to prove that the touch UI works and is useful.
  *  I found an almost new freezer on craigs list for $80.

I ended up with a Haier 7.1 cu ft chest freezer.  It can easily hold 3 corny kegs plus all the Co2 gear and I may just barely be able to get a 4th corny keg in.  If not I'll probably grab a 2.5 gallon keg to sit on the 'shelf'.
